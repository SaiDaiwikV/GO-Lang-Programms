# Go-Lang-Programms 🚀

This repository contains a collection of **Go (Golang) programs** that demonstrate fundamental programming concepts.  
It’s designed as a step-by-step learning resource — starting from the basics like variables and constants, to more advanced topics like maps and variadic functions.

| `3_variables` | `variables.go` | Declaring and using variables |
| `4_constants` | `constants.go` | Constants in Go |
| `5_for-loop` | `for-loop.go` | Different forms of `for` loops |
| `6_if-else` | `if-else.go` | Conditional statements |
| `7_switch-statement` | `switch.go` | Switch case examples |
| `8_Arrays` | `arrays.go` | Arrays in Go |
| `9_slices` | `slices.go` | Slices and slice operations |
| `10_maps` | `maps.go` | Maps (key-value pairs) |
| `11_range` | `range.go` | Using `range` with arrays, slices, and maps |
| `12_functions` | `functions.go` | Defining and using functions |
| `13_Variadic_Functions` | `variadic_func.go` | Variadic functions (functions with variable number of arguments) |
